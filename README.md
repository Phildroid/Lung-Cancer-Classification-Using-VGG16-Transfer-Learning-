Lung Cancer Classification Using VGG16 (Transfer Learning) |TensorFlow|Keras|OpenCV 

● Built a multiclass classification model using VGG16 pre-trained on ImageNet, applied to histopathological lung cancer 
images.

● Focused on 3 lung classes (benign, adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma) from a 25,000-image dataset; 
performed preprocessing, augmentation, and one-hot encoding. 

● Constructed a custom fully connected head with global average pooling and dense layers. 

● Achieved 98.46% classification accuracy in 5 training epochs. 

● Visualized performance metrics and implemented end-to-end data pipelines in Google Colab.
